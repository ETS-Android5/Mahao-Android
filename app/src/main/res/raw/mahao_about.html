        <strong>About Mahao</strong>
        <p>
            Mahao is an Android application that recommends houses for rent to users.
            This application uses a recommender system that allows users to conduct a
            preference-based search for rental homes. The recommendations will be based on
            a collaborative recommendation model. This means that the user-user relationship,
            as well as the user-item relationship, plays a role in the recommendation. The
            application was the fourth-year project submitted in partial fulfilment of the
            requirements for a BSc. Computer Science.
